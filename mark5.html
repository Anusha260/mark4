        <p> Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features
            and tasks literally a framework to build websites or web applications around.JavaScript tends to be very fast because it is often run immediately within the client browser. So long as it does not require outside resources, JavaScript is not
            slowed down by calls to a backend server. Also, major browsers all support JIT compilation for JavaScript, meaning that there is no need to compile the code before running it.JavaScript can be used to create features like drag and drop and
            components such as sliders, all of which greatly enhance the user interface and experience of a site.In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes
            them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.</p>
