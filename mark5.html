        <p> Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features
            and tasks literally a framework to build websites or web applications around.JavaScript tends to be very fast because it is often run immediately within the client browser. So long as it does not require outside resources, JavaScript is not
            slowed down by calls to a backend server. Also, major browsers all support JIT compilation for JavaScript, meaning that there is no need to compile the code before running it.JavaScript can be used to create features like drag and drop and
            components such as sliders, all of which greatly enhance the user interface and experience of a site.In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes
            them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.The word dynamic is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages.it refers to the ability to update the display of a web page to show different things in different circumstances, generating new content as required. Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g. pulling data from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client, e.g. creating a new HTML table, filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the table in a web page shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related, and both approaches usually work together.JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called just-in-time compiling to improve performance.
