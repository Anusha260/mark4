        <h1>Golconda</h1>
        <p>
            It was originally a mud fort under the reign of Rajah of Warangal. Later it was fortified between 14th and 17th centuries by the Bahmani Sultans and then the ruling Qutub Shahi dynasty. Golconda was the principal capital of the Qutub Shahi kings.The Golconda
            fort was initially called Gul Kunda, meaning “cut like a flower” and also Golla Konda meaning “Shepherd's Hill”. However, a myth took root that the place got its name because a shepherd used to graze his sheep there. Shivaji's historic visit
            to Haidarabad, the capital of the Qutb Shahi Kingdom of Golkonda, took place in February 1677. ... Qutb Shah was already paying Shivaji one lakh of hun as annual tribute. He showed his willingness to welcome Shivaji in his capital and to hold
            direct talks with the celebrated Maratha hero.
