        <p>It underpins our economy, our society, indeed our very existence. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and
            services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third closest to
            the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Nature can help provide ideas to all the problems you face. That's because nature can improve our brains abilities, boosting memory performance and attention span
            by around 20% with just an hour spent outside.</p>
